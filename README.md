# mithril-boilerplate
A boilerplate for gulp+mithril+webpack+browser-sync+axis.

This is mostly for personal archiving but it maybe of value to others and a good starting place for handling both frontend & backend.

`npm install;gulp` will build and start both the frontend and backend.

Contains the following

| Package      | Description                                                                                                 |
